#Tech Acronym Snippets

Just some snippets to use while blogging in TextMate to bring up some `<abbr>` tags for common tech abbreviations. Just press tab after writing an abbreviation, and it may or may not add the `<abbr>` tag. -- depending on if we've added it yet. You can also type **abbr+[TAB]** to create your own abbreviation, and tab stop through the code via placeholders. 

Thanks to Steven Millward for doing most of this. 
Any suggested additions, let me know.
